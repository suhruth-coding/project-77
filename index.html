    <p>Visual studio is really easy to setup. First, download the extension. Next, choose the colour theme and you're ready to go.</p>
    <p>Console screen is really useful. We can use it to check our code line to line so that we know where to correct it. We just have to use the code "console.log" to check our code.</p>
